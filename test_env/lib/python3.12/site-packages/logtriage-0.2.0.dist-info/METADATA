`log-triage` is a Python tool that sits between your log collector (for example Fluent Bit) and an LLM. It filters noisy logs, detects problems, and gives you a dashboard and API-ready payloads so you can triage faster.

## Overview

### Key concepts
- **Pipelines:** Reusable recipes that define how to group log lines, which regexes to ignore or count, and which prompt template to use for LLM payloads.
- **Modules:** Runtime bindings that attach a pipeline to a file path and decide whether to scan once (batch) or tail continuously (follow) with rotation awareness.
- **Findings:** Structured outputs for each grouped chunk, including severity (WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL), counts, and optional LLM payloads.
- **Addressed & false positives:** Workflow flags in the dashboard; marking a false positive also writes an ignore regex back to the pipeline to prevent repeats.

### How it works
`log-triage` watches your logs, passes them through a configured pipeline, and surfaces only the important pieces:

1. **Collect:** Point a module at a log file (or directory) to read entries once or continuously with rotation handling.
2. **Group:** Apply the pipeline's grouping strategy (whole-file or marker-based) to carve the stream into logical chunks.
3. **Classify:** Count warnings and errors with regex rules, ignore known-noise patterns, and assign a severity.
4. **Enrich:** Generate an LLM payload per finding using your prompt template and context lines.
5. **Deliver:** Print findings, send alerts (webhook/MQTT), store them for the Web UI, and use the dashboard to reclassify, mark false positives, or update severity.

### Getting started
1. **Install the package:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   # Install core plus optional Web UI + MQTT extras
   pip install ".[webui,alerts]"
   ```
2. **Configure:** Copy `config.yaml` and edit pipelines/modules to point at your log files.
3. **Run a module:**
   ```bash
   logtriage --config ./config.yaml run --module <module-name>
   ```
4. **Open the dashboard (optional):**
   ```bash
   export LOGTRIAGE_CONFIG=./config.yaml
   logtriage-webui
   ```
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8090` to review findings, adjust severity, or mark false positives.

## Features

- YAML configuration for both pipelines and modules
- Multiple pipelines, selected by name or filename regex
- Grouping strategies (each in its own module):
  - whole-file grouping
  - marker-based grouping (for example per rsnapshot run)
- Classifiers (each in its own module):
  - generic regex counter
  - rsnapshot-specific heuristic
- Per-pipeline ignore rules (`ignore_regexes`) to drop known-noise lines before counting
- Severity levels:
  - WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Batch mode (scan file or directory once)
- Follow mode (continuous tail of a single log file), rotation-aware (`tail -F` style)
- Optional config change detection for follow-mode modules to auto-reload after saving via the Web UI (`--reload-on-change`)
- Optional LLM payload generation with conservative gating and per-pipeline prompt templates
- Per-module options for:
  - context lines included ahead of each finding (`llm.context_prefix_lines`)
  - alert hooks (`alerts.mqtt`, `alerts.webhook`)
- Optional SQL database integration for storing per-finding records (SQLite or Postgres)
- Web UI (FastAPI) to:
  - log in with username/password (bcrypt)
  - view modules and per-module stats (last severity, 24h error/warning counts, etc.)
  - inspect and edit `config.yaml` (atomic writes, with backup)
  - experiment with regexes (regex lab) and save them to classifiers
  - run on a dark-mode layout
